/**
 * Manages a V2 floating IP resource within OpenStack Nova (compute)
 * that can be used for compute instances.
 *
 * Please note that managing floating IPs through the OpenStack Compute API has
 * been deprecated. Unless you are using an older OpenStack environment, it is
 * recommended to use the `openstack.networking.FloatingIp`
 * resource instead, which uses the OpenStack Networking API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const floatip1 = new openstack.compute.FloatingIp("floatip_1", {
 *     pool: "public",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Floating IPs can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import openstack:compute/floatingIp:FloatingIp floatip_1 89c60255-9bd6-460c-822a-e2b959ede9d2
 * ```
