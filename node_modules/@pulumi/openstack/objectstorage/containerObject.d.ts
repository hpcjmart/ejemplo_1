/**
 * Manages a V1 container object resource within OpenStack.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Example with simple content
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const container1 = new openstack.objectstorage.Container("container_1", {
 *     contentType: "application/json",
 *     metadata: {
 *         test: "true",
 *     },
 *     region: "RegionOne",
 * });
 * const doc1 = new openstack.objectstorage.ContainerObject("doc_1", {
 *     containerName: container1.name,
 *     content: `               {
 *                  "foo" : "bar"
 *                }
 * `,
 *     contentType: "application/json",
 *     metadata: {
 *         test: "true",
 *     },
 *     region: "RegionOne",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Example with content from file
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const container1 = new openstack.objectstorage.Container("container_1", {
 *     contentType: "application/json",

 *     },

 * });
 * const doc1 = new openstack.objectstorage.ContainerObject("doc_1", {
 *     containerName: container1.name,
