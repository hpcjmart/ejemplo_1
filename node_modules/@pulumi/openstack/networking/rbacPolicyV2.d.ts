/**
 * The RBAC policy resource contains functionality for working with Neutron RBAC
 * Policies. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy framework enables both
 * operators and users to grant access to resources for specific projects.
 *
 * Sharing an object with a specific project is accomplished by creating a
 * policy entry that permits the target project the `accessAsShared` action
 * on that object.
 *
 * To make a network available as an external network for specific projects
 * rather than all projects, use the `accessAsExternal` action.
 * If a network is marked as external during creation, it now implicitly creates
 * a wildcard RBAC policy granting everyone access to preserve previous behavior
 * before this feature was added.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const network1 = new openstack.networking.Network("network_1", {
 *     adminStateUp: true,
 * });
 * const rbacPolicy1 = new openstack.networking.RbacPolicyV2("rbac_policy_1", {
 *     action: "access_as_shared",
 *     objectId: network1.id,
 *     objectType: "network",
 *     targetTenant: "20415a973c9e45d3917f078950644697",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RBAC policies can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import openstack:networking/rbacPolicyV2:RbacPolicyV2 rbac_policy_1 eae26a3e-1c33-4cc1-9c31-0cd729c438a1
 * ```
