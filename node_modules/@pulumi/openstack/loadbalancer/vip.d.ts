/**
 * Manages a V1 load balancer vip resource within OpenStack.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const vip1 = new openstack.loadbalancer.Vip("vip_1", {
 *     poolId: "67890",
 *     port: 80,
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     subnetId: "12345",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Load Balancer VIPs can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import openstack:loadbalancer/vip:Vip vip_1 50e16b26-89c1-475e-a492-76167182511e
 * ```
