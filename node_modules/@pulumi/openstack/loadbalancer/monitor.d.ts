import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages a V2 monitor resource within OpenStack.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const monitor1 = new openstack.loadbalancer.Monitor("monitor_1", {
 *     delay: 20,
 *     maxRetries: 5,
 *     poolId: openstack_lb_pool_v2_pool_1.id,
 *     timeout: 10,
 *     type: "PING",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Load Balancer Pool Monitor can be imported using the Monitor ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import openstack:loadbalancer/monitor:Monitor monitor_1 47c26fc3-2403-427a-8c79-1589bd0533c2
 * ```
 *
 *  In case of using OpenContrail, the import may not work properly. If you face an issue, try to import the monitor providing its parent pool ID
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import openstack:loadbalancer/monitor:Monitor monitor_1 47c26fc3-2403-427a-8c79-1589bd0533c2/708bc224-0f8c-4981-ac82-97095fe051b6
 * ```
