/**
 * Manages a V2 pool resource within OpenStack.
 *
 * > **Note:** This resource has attributes that depend on octavia minor versions.
 * Please ensure your Openstack cloud supports the required minor version.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const pool1 = new openstack.loadbalancer.Pool("pool_1", {
 *     lbMethod: "ROUND_ROBIN",
 *     listenerId: "d9415786-5f1a-428b-b35f-2f1523e146d2",
 *     persistence: {
 *         cookieName: "testCookie",
 *         type: "APP_COOKIE",
 *     },
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Load Balancer Pool can be imported using the Pool ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import openstack:loadbalancer/pool:Pool pool_1 60ad9ee4-249a-4d60-a45b-aa60e046c513
 * ```
